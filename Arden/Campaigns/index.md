# Arden Campaigns

## Sheercleft
Nestled in the mountains of the Ice Cap Peaks, the mining village of Sheercleft is caught amidst a trade conflict between two of their main trading partners. To the north lies the minor dwarven hall of Khaz a Grungron, and to the west the treetop elven village of Hyarantar. For the sake of the village, the party must find a solution to the disagreement between these settlements. However, all is not as it seems, both at home and away.

Sheercleft is a small mining settlement of a few hundred souls built around the top of the Sheercleft Ravine, the sides of which are rich with valuable ore. The ravine runs north-west to south-east between four mountains and Sheercleft has been built in a round basin the surrounds a stretch of it. The ravine runs directly through the middle of this basin, splitting Sheercleft into two half. The easterly side of the village is referred to as Shamleyside and contains most of the residential buildings, whereas the western side of the basin, known as Quenlan Row, is dedicated to the supporting the workings of the mine and houses administrative and industrial buildings. The mining equipment itself surrounds the ravine on both sides.

To the north of of Sheercleft the mountains extend into dwarven territory. Dwarven society consists of largely independent Holds, each ruled by its own Lord. These Lords, in theory, all answer to the Dwarven High King. However, it is rare for the the King to interfere with the inner workings of another Hold. Some Holds are small villages built into the side of a mountain, while the major Holds are vast subterranean cities. The dwarves worship a pantheon of gods known as the Morndinsamman, chief amongst whom is the god Moradin.

West of Sheercleft the mountains eventually give way to the vast and ancient Eldren forest. This is the most centralised seat of elven civilisation in all of Arden, insofar as one exists at all. This part of the world is wild and brims with natural energy. The walls between the material plane and the feywild wear especially thin here.

East lies the human kingdom of Breanne. Breanne is a feudal nation ruled by a King who is supported by the noble houses. These in turn each control one of the major duchies. Breanne is known for its knights and its primary religious figure is a river goddess who most simply refer to as "The Lady". It was nobles from Breanne who originally founded Sheercleft.

The lands south of Sheercleft are wild and untamed. Orc tribes, giantkin and other menaces roam these frigid stormy mountains and far to the south wild human barbarians raid the coastline.

## Hunters
Dark forests lurk beyond the borders of Tanem's most rural of villages, and the wilderness seems to have a mind of its own as it encroaches from all sides. For those poor souls who call these places their home, travelling bands of monster hunters can mean the difference between salvation and destruction at the hand of whatever comes creeping out of the woods at night... if you can afford them.

## Hellenia
Enter the Hellenian savannah, a wilderness claimed by bandits, and beasts alike. Into this territory the town of Appolis sends its emissaries, tasking them with subduing the lawless folk and deadly creatures that have made it a realm of savagery and shame. Beyond the last rugged frontier stretches the home of voracious monsters and wily natives. Can you survive and bring these dangerous lands to heel? Or will you just be one more fateful band, lost forever to the ravenous wilds?

## Guard Duty
The rural mining village of Sheercleft in the Ice Cap Peaks was recently occupied by a goblin army under the leadership of the fearsome Warlord Kung. Thanks to the courage and skill of a band of local heroes, the goblins and their allies, a cabal of wizards whispered to be named the Mabinogi, have since been driven off into the mountains. However, for the inhabitants of Sheercleft, this is only the beginning. The village must be rebuilt and fortified against other threats and trade routes must be reopened if the the mines are to flourish.

Jex Blake, one of Sheercleft's new heroes, has gathered together a merchant caravan to travel south-east to the duchy of Quenlan in the neighbouring kingdom of Breanne. The 300 mile journey will see the caravan traversing mountain trails and dark forest, before the road finally reaches the relative safety of Breannian farmlands. Those who attempt the venture will need stout hearts and steady nerves if they are to be successful, but amongst mountain men neither are in short supply.
